# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze time series data related to loyalty card customers using an ARIMA model to calculate customer lifetime value.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels
```

## Usage
1. Ensure that the `loyalty-card-customers.csv` file is in the same directory as the `arima-timeseries-cltv.py` script.
2. Run the ARIMA model by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python arima-timeseries-cltv.py
   ```

## File Descriptions
- **arima-timeseries-cltv.py**: This Python script uses ARIMA for time series analysis to calculate customer lifetime value.
- **loyalty-card-customers.csv**: This CSV file contains data related to loyalty card customers, which might be used as input for the ARIMA model.
- **loyalty-credit-card-ibm.py**: This Python script is likely another part of the project that handles credit card loyalty programs.
